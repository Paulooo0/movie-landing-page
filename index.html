            Riko is a 12-year-old orphan from the town at the edge of The Abyss, Orth, and the main protagonist of Made in Abyss. She is the only child of the White Whistle Lyza, the Annihilator.

          <p>
            Reg is a robotic being who appears to be a little boy, and the deuteragonist of Made in Abyss. His actual age and origins are unknown, because he cannot recall anything about his life before his encounter with Riko. Riko names him "Reg", after a dog that she used to own. Later, it is revealed that he also went by the name "Reg" prior to ever meeting Riko. He is a member of Riko's squad, Hello Abyss.
